What makes it even more difficult is that the proprietor/head chef, Tom Billings, had no idea of the makeover - the submission made by his loving family, his Aunt Marge, the diner waitress, and his teen daughter, Claire - and resists any change to Rocko's in reverence and memory to his deceased parents, from who he inherited the diner, and his regulars who he believes expect \"diner\" in what he presents to them. The diner is despite Tom actually having innate culinary skills beyond that of a diner line cook, and he long having fantasized about something different than a diner if he were to start a culinary life all over again, something that both Marge and Claire know. As Tom reluctantly gives in in honoring Marge and Claire, and as Abby and Tom seem to be able to find a middle ground in what Rocko's should actually be, the two start to fall for each other, the chemistry which Kenna and the camera, and by association the network, can see.
